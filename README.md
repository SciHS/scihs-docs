# SciHS Documentation

The purpose of this repository is document the existing support for numerical computing and data science in the Haskell ecosystem.

**NB:** This effort has just begun, so there is precious little material so far. We will extend it over time and warmly welcome any contributions from the community. We are interested in original contributions in this repository (tutorials, API documentation, sample applications, etc). We are also interested in link collections to external resources on numerical computing and data science in the Haskell.


## Tweag I/O blog post series on array programming

[Tweag I/O](https://tweag.io) is currently running a series of blog post that provides an overview over the array programming support in Haskell â€” with a focus on well maintained packages that have seen an uptake by the community.
